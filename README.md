# â›” LARGELY UNUSABLE/DEPRECIATED -- Template Email Signature

Because of lacking email client support for modern technologies like [CSS grid](https://www.caniemail.com/features/css-display-grid), [CSS flex-direction](https://www.caniemail.com/features/css-display-grid), and even the [HTML `<style>` element](https://www.caniemail.com/features/html-style), this email template likely won't work for many people. __Even if your email provider supports the needed features, sending an email to an email client that doesn't support these features causes problems, most likely the signature not being visible to them. See [StackOverflow discussion re: grid disappearing](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55218276) and [StackOverflow discussion re: grid email alternatives](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69150989).__

Feel free to use it if it does happen to work for you (i.e. you know the email clients of your recipients), but more traditional email signature generators using HTML tables are most likely to be supported in your specific email client.

In the future, it's possible that I may make a second repository using only technologies that are supported in all Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook, and Proton Mail clients and that have 80%+ estimate support as determined by [caniemail.com](https://www.caniemail.com/support). Ideally, within the next few years, all major email clients will implement the features needed for this.

_A simple HTML email signature template, complete with links, pronouns, and other information. Consider self-hosting the icons somewhere else, as I may not host these icons at that specific path forever. I'm not planning on giving any support for these, but you can try opening an issue if you need some help. No promises I'll help ðŸ˜›_
